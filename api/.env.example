# Security reminder:
# - Never commit a real .env into git. Add /api/.env to .gitignore (already present).
# - If a key is exposed (you already committed one), revoke it immediately in the provider dashboard and create a new key.
# - For production, set these values in your host's environment variable panel (Render, Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
